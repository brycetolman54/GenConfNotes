## Saturday Morning

### Jeffrey R Holland

- We need to be commited disciples of Jesus Christ, we cannot be members in name only

### J Anette Dennis

- Wearing the sacred garment is a sacred <b>obligation</b> and <b>privilege</b> that we have
- Focus more on the symbols of the ordinances and covenants you participate in to see what you can learn about them

### Alexander Dushku

- Help your children to understand that the Lord gives us a tesimony bit by bit, ray by ray
- Help them to see those litte rays and to recognize the glory of them

### Ulysses S Soares

- We need to help our children, over all, to gain confidence in the Lord and in that power can come from the covenants we make with Him
- <i>What are you doing to prioritize temple attendance? What are you doing to prepare for your experiences in the temple?</i>
- Having unkind feelings about others gives place for the enemy of our soul in our hearts because it drives out the Spirit.
    - I need to strive harder to keep unkind thoughts about others from my heart

### Jack N Gerard

- Be true to yourself, God, and others
- This means not lowering your standards for anyone or anything. This is a great <i>Christlike</i> attribute
- I want to strive to live so that nothing in my private life, if brought to the public eye, would bring embarassment to myself, my family, the Church, or God
- I want people to be able to see God through my integrity
- "Christian kindness is not a substitue of integrity"
- I want to help my children to see their divine potential so they can be true to the person that they are able to become

### Henry B Eyring

- I need to make more of an effort to get to the temple and feel the Spirit there, that is what the Lord wants of me
- <i>Do I live in such a way that the Lord would trust me to take the call He wants to give me?</i>
    - I need to practice actually prioritizing the Lord and the things He finds most important in my life, I need to not procrastinate that until I feel I <b>able</b>


## Saturday Afternoon

### David A Bednar

- Christ is not the foundation, we must build our foundation on Him. He is like the bedrock to which we want to connect through covenants.
    - I think it is interesting to consider how the soil above the bedrock could represent things like church culture. It is somewhat solid, it is based on the Lord, but it is not Him. It can change. We cannot connect to it alone or we will fall
- I think I need to improve my sabbath observance. <i>Think about how to do so</i>
- We need to bring the Spirit back to our homes from the temple and church attendance. The home is a continuation of those experiences.

### Massimo de Feo
