## Saturday Morning

### Jeffrey R Holland

- We need to be commited disciples of Jesus Christ, we cannot be members in name only

### J Anette Dennis

- Wearing the sacred garment is a sacred <b>obligation</b> and <b>privilege</b> that we have
- Focus more on the symbols of the ordinances and covenants you participate in to see what you can learn about them

### Alexander Dushku

- Help your children to understand that the Lord gives us a tesimony bit by bit, ray by ray
- Help them to see those litte rays and to recognize the glory of them

### Ulysses S Soares

- We need to help our children, over all, to gain confidence in the Lord and in that power can come from the covenants we make with Him
- <i>What are you doing to prioritize temple attendance? What are you doing to prepare for your experiences in the temple?</i>
- Having unkind feelings about others gives place for the enemy of our soul in our hearts because it drives out the Spirit.
    - I need to strive harder to keep unkind thoughts about others from my heart

### Jack N Gerard

- Be true to yourself, God, and others
- This means not lowering your standards for anyone or anything. This is a great <i>Christlike</i> attribute
- I want to strive to live so that nothing in my private life, if brought to the public eye, would bring embarassment to myself, my family, the Church, or God
- I want people to be able to see God through my integrity
- "Christian kindness is not a substitue of integrity"
- I want to help my children to see their divine potential so they can be true to the person that they are able to become

### Henry B Eyring

- I need to make more of an effort to get to the temple and feel the Spirit there, that is what the Lord wants of me
- <i>Do I live in such a way that the Lord would trust me to take the call He wants to give me?</i>
    - I need to practice actually prioritizing the Lord and the things He finds most important in my life, I need to not procrastinate that until I feel I <b>able</b>


## Saturday Afternoon

### David A Bednar

- Christ is not the foundation, we must build our foundation on Him. He is like the bedrock to which we want to connect through covenants.
    - I think it is interesting to consider how the soil above the bedrock could represent things like church culture. It is somewhat solid, it is based on the Lord, but it is not Him. It can change. We cannot connect to it alone or we will fall
- I think I need to improve my sabbath observance. <i>Think about how to do so</i>
- We need to bring the Spirit back to our homes from the temple and church attendance. The home is a continuation of those experiences.

### Massimo de Feo

- Part of acting in faith is to cast off the beggar's coat of scorn or bad feelings once we have forgiven another or ourselves

### Brent H Nielson

- I want to do a better job of recording my witnesses in my journal for my posterity to see someday

### Jose L Alonso

- When I think of heaenly visits, I often think of things like being visited by an angel as Nephi and his brothers were or as Joseph Smith was. I want to change that thinking. Heavenly visits can come by the Spirit or by others sent by God. Don't be insensitive to those visits. Have an open heart and be willing to surrender when the Lord desires it of you.

### Gerrit W Gong


### Michael T Nelson

- I wonder how often I decide to rely on my own strength instead of turning to the Lord to receive His strength. God does want people that act for themselves, but I feel like I take that idea too far sometimes. I want to counsel more with the Lord andbecome more humble instead of just going to God thinking I know it all already
- While family is the central unit of society and is central to the eternal destiny of all of God's children, I still think there is something to say about wards and stakes and those called therein to serve the youth. We can do our part, not to replace the role of parents, but to supplement it.

### Quentin L Cook

- One of the greatest things abot the Gospel is that it is available to all who want to partkae of it. There is nothing inherently keeping anoyone fromm accepting the Atonement of the Lord.
- I want to teach my children of the importance of agency and what it means for them in their lives. It is truly one of the greatest gifts that we have. We get to <b>choose</b> what we want to do and who we want to become. <i>Is that not one of the most enabling thoughts?</i>


## Saturday Evening

### Shayne M Bowen

- I want to live worthy every day to use the priesthood power to bless my family and others
- I want to live a life such that I have the faith to bless others with what God has in store for them, to not allow my lack of faith or worthiness to be what keeps them from receiving the blessings they deserve

### Steven R Bangerter

- I want to teach my children their worth and value, that they have been foreordained for great things. I want to help them cultivate their talents and develop them to the point that they can bless others with them.
- I need to remember to protect the private times of my life, to use that time when I think nobody else is there or will be affected for good
    - <b><i>Aun un grado</i></b>, remember that Bryce

### Andrea Munoz Spannaus

- Another comment about understanding our true identity. Maybe make that a study topic
- Another comment about being connected to Christ

### Matthew L Carpenter

- I don't think I do a good job counseling with my wife. I think I either am stuck in my ways or just allow her to do what she wants. I need to get better at that
- Include in your prayers the plea to become a better spouse. And <b>be specific</b> with what you pray for

### Dieter F Uchtdorf

- If I want to feel joy in my marriage, I need to focus on Rylie having joy
